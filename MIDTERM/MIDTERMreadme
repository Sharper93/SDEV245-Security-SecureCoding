CIA Triad Explanation
- Confidentiality: We use AES-256 bit key which makes it unreadable to unauthorized users. This meaning even if the message is intercepted, the person cannot decrypt it without the key and nonce. 
- Integrity: By hashing the message with SHA-256 before and after encryption/decryption, we ensure it wasn't altered. 
- Availabllity: Script can be run anytime locally, ensuring data is accessable when needed. 


Entropy & Key Generation
Entrohpy: 
 - Strong randomness is crucial for secure keys and numbers used only once. We use os.urandom() and the cryptography library's secure key generation to ensure high entropy. 
 - Prevents predictable keys, which could be exploited by attacker. 
Key Generation:
 - AES key generated using AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=256), which ensures a securely random 256-bit key. 
 - This key must be securely stored or shared to maintain confidentiality.
